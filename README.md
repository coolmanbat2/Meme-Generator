# Meme Generator

Meme Generator is an Xcode application that is specifically used for the iPhone to have fun with preset meme templates.

## Requirements
- Xcode 11.6
- iPhone Simulation (Pre-installed Xcode tools)
- MacBook, iMac, or some other computer that can run the latest version of macOS.

## Installation

*Note: The files can only be opened on the latest version of Xcode (11.6 as of August 28, 2020). Additionally, you MUST have a mac in order to run the iPhone application only.*

1) Download XCode 11.6 on your Mac
2) Clone this repository 
3) Installation Complete, Yay!!! :)

## How to run the iPhone simulation.

Assuming you have appropriately setup the workflow of the application.

1) On the top right of your workflow environment click the play button.
2) Sit back and watch your app run on an iPhone simulation.

## How to run on your own iPhone.

It's the same process as running on an iPhone simulation, except you need to specify the iPhone that you are using.

## Usage
Simply open the application, choose your meme from a selection of preset memes, then type text at the top and/or bottom for a cool funny meme that you and your friends can relate to.

## Project Status
The project has been completed, but I may come back to add more features like saving and adding custom images.
